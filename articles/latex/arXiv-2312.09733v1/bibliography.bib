The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is at least 0.9326. This improves, and also somewhat simplifies, a result of Feige, Karpinski and Langberg. We also observe that results of Hopkins and Staton and of Bondy and Locke yield a simple combinatorial 4/5-approximation algorithm for the problem. Slightly improved results would appear in the full version of the paper.},

Chem. Theory Comput., 2016, 12, 1760). Next to this active space selection, autoCAS carries out several steps of multiconfigurational calculations so that only a minimal input is required to start them, comparable to that of a standard Kohn?Sham density-functional theory calculation, so that black-box multiconfigurational calculations become feasible. Furthermore, we introduce a new extension to the selection algorithm that facilitates automated selections for molecules with large valence orbital spaces consisting of several hundred orbitals. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Booth2009,
abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O2, CH4, and NaH—with FCI spaces ranging from 109 to 1014, whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

Advances in quantum computing, especially over the past several years, provide opportunities for alternatives to classical methods. Here, we present a general quantum circuit estimating both the energy and eigenstates corrections that is far superior to the classical version when estimating second-order energy corrections. We demonstrate our approach as applied to the two-site extended Hubbard model. In addition to numerical simulations based on qiskit, results on IBM?s quantum hardware are also presented. Our work offers a general approach to studying complex systems with quantum devices, with no training or optimization process needed to obtain the perturbative terms, which can be generalized to other Hamiltonian systems both in chemistry and physics. A general quantum circuit for perturbation theory calculations with implementation on IBM?s machines is reported.},

@article{Bayliss2020,
abstract = {Spins in solid-state systems such as quantum dots and defect centers in diamond can easily be controlled by light for use in quantum information processing. More challenging is tuning their properties and making large arrays, something that can be done more easily with spins in molecules. Bayliss et al. combined the advantages of the two approaches by designing and characterizing three related molecular species that are optically addressable. The molecules consist of a central chromium ion surrounded by organic ligands, and their spin and optical properties can be tailored by simply changing the positions of methyl groups on the ligands. Science, this issue p. 1309 Three organometallic molecules that can be controlled by light are designed and characterized. Spin-bearing molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies as they can be chemically tuned, assembled into scalable arrays, and readily incorporated into diverse device architectures. In molecular systems, optically addressing ground-state spins would enable a wide range of applications in quantum information science, as has been demonstrated for solid-state defects. However, this important functionality has remained elusive for molecules. Here, we demonstrate such optical addressability in a series of synthesized organometallic, chromium(IV) molecules. These compounds display a ground-state spin that can be initialized and read out using light and coherently manipulated with microwaves. In addition, through atomistic modification of the molecular structure, we vary the spin and optical properties of these compounds, indicating promise for designer quantum systems synthesized from the bottom-up.},

@article{Zhou2022,
abstract = {Strong electron correlation plays an important role in transition-metal and heavy-metal chemistry, magnetic molecules, bond breaking, biradicals, excited states, and many functional materials, but it provides a significant challenge for modern electronic structure theory. The treatment of strongly correlated systems usually requires a multireference method to adequately describe spin densities and near-degeneracy correlation. However, quantitative computation of dynamic correlation with multireference wave functions is often difficult or impractical. Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) provides a way to blend multiconfiguration wave function theory and density functional theory to quantitatively treat both near-degeneracy correlation and dynamic correlation in strongly correlated systems; it is more affordable than multireference perturbation theory, multireference configuration interaction, or multireference coupled cluster theory and more accurate for many properties than Kohn–Sham density functional theory. This perspective article provides a brief introduction to strongly correlated systems and previously reviewed progress on MC-PDFT followed by a discussion of several recent developments and applications of MC-PDFT and related methods, including localized-active-space MC-PDFT, generalized active-space MC-PDFT, density-matrix-renormalization-group MC-PDFT, hybrid MC-PDFT, multistate MC-PDFT, spin–orbit coupling, analytic gradients, and dipole moments. We also review the more recently introduced multiconfiguration nonclassical-energy functional theory (MC-NEFT), which is like MC-PDFT but allows for other ingredients in the nonclassical-energy functional. We discuss two new kinds of MC-NEFT methods, namely multiconfiguration density coherence functional theory and machine-learned functionals.},

abstract = {A configuration selection method for CI calculations is discussed and applied in which the energy lowering produced in a secular equation by the addition of a given test species to a series of dominant configurations is used as an ordering parameter. Configurations with energy lowerings below a given energy cut-off value are not included in the final secular equations but instead a method of estimating the combined effect of the neglected species on the corresponding non-selected CI results is developed. The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to aseries of dominant configurations in a given state are included.},

abstract = {The optical spectra of neutral oxygen vacancies (F0 centers) in the bulk MgO lattice are investigated using density matrix embedding theory. The impurity Hamiltonian is solved with the complete active space self-consistent field and second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2-DMET) multireference methods. To estimate defect-localized vertical excitation energies at the nonembedding and thermodynamic limits, a double extrapolation scheme is employed. The extrapolated NEVPT2-DMET vertical excitation energy value of 5.24 eV agrees well with the experimental absorption maxima at 5.03 eV, whereas the excitation energy value of 2.89 eV at the relaxed triplet defect-localized state geometry overestimates the experimental emission at 2.4 eV by only nearly 0.5 eV, indicating the involvement of the triplet-singlet decay pathway.},

We further use pDME-PDFT to calculate local excitations in larger supercells for the monovacancy defect, for which the use of nonembedded MC-PDFT is prohibitively costly.},

@article{kim2023evidence,
	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5.},

    abstract = { The investigation of water oxidation in photosynthesis has remained a central topic in biochemical research for the last few decades due to the importance of this catalytic process for technological applications. Significant progress has been made following the 2011 report of a high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure resolving the site of catalysis, a protein-bound Mn4CaOx complex, which passes through ≥5 intermediate states in the water-splitting cycle. Spectroscopic techniques complemented by quantum chemical calculations aided in understanding the electronic structure of the cofactor in all (detectable) states of the enzymatic process. Together with isotope labeling, these techniques also revealed the binding of the two substrate water molecules to the cluster. These results are described in the context of recent progress using X-ray crystallography with free-electron lasers on these intermediates. The data are instrumental for developing a model for the biological water oxidation cycle. }

QuEST is the first open source, hybrid multithreaded and distributed, GPU accelerated simulator of universal quantum circuits. Embodied as a C library, it is designed so that a user’s code can be deployed seamlessly to any platform from a laptop to a supercomputer. QuEST is capable of simulating generic quantum circuits of general one and two-qubit gates and multi-qubit controlled gates, on pure and mixed states, represented as state-vectors and density matrices, and under the presence of decoherence. Using the ARCUS and ARCHER supercomputers, we benchmark QuEST’s simulation of random circuits of up to 38 qubits, distributed over up to 2048 compute nodes, each with up to 24 cores. We directly compare QuEST’s performance to ProjectQ’s on single machines, and discuss the differences in distribution strategies of QuEST, qHipster and Quantum++. QuEST shows excellent scaling, both strong and weak, on multicore and distributed architectures.}

In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.}}

abstract = {Acoustic metamaterials can manipulate and control sound waves in ways that are not possible in conventional materials. Metamaterials with zero, or even negative, refractive index for sound offer new possibilities for acoustic imaging and for the control of sound at subwavelength scales. The combination of transformation acoustics theory and highly anisotropic acoustic metamaterials enables precise control over the deformation of sound fields, which can be used, for example, to hide or cloak objects from incident acoustic energy. Active acoustic metamaterials use external control to create effective material properties that are not possible with passive structures and have led to the development of dynamically reconfigurable, loss-compensating and parity–time-symmetric materials for sound manipulation. Challenges remain, including the development of efficient techniques for fabricating large-scale metamaterial structures and converting laboratory experiments into useful devices. In this Review, we outline the designs and properties of materials with unusual acoustic parameters (for example, negative refractive index), discuss examples of extreme manipulation of sound and, finally, provide an overview of future directions in the field.}

  abstract={Mechanical metamaterials exhibit properties and functionalities that cannot be realized in conventional materials. Originally, the field focused on achieving unusual (zero or negative) values for familiar mechanical parameters, such as density, Poisson's ratio or compressibility, but more recently, new classes of metamaterials — including shape-morphing, topological and nonlinear metamaterials — have emerged. These materials exhibit exotic functionalities, such as pattern and shape transformations in response to mechanical forces, unidirectional guiding of motion and waves, and reprogrammable stiffness or dissipation. In this Review, we identify the design principles leading to these properties and discuss, in particular, linear and mechanism-based metamaterials (such as origami-based and kirigami-based metamaterials), metamaterials harnessing instabilities and frustration, and topological metamaterials. We conclude by outlining future challenges for the design, creation and conceptualization of advanced mechanical metamaterials.}

Such wireless body networks are, however, typically energy-inefficient and vulnerable to eavesdropping because they rely on radio-wave communications. Here, we report energy-efficient and secure wireless body sensor networks that are interconnected through radio surface plasmons propagating on metamaterial textiles. The approach uses clothing made from conductive fabrics that can support surface-plasmon-like modes at radio communication frequencies. Our body sensor networks enhance transmission efficiencies by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional radiative networks without the metamaterial textile, and confine wireless communication to within 10 cm of the body. We also show that the approach can offer wireless power transfer that is robust to motion and textile-based wireless touch sensing.}

  abstract= {Quantum technology is maturing to the point where quantum devices, such as quantum communication systems, quantum random number generators and quantum simulators may be built with capabilities exceeding classical computers. A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms.}

  abstract= {We computationally designed an ultranarrow-band wavelength-selective thermal radiator via a materials informatics method alternating between Bayesian optimization and thermal electromagnetic field calculation. For a given target infrared wavelength, the optimal structure was efficiently identified from over 8 billion candidates of multilayers consisting of multiple components (Si, Ge, and SiO2). The resulting optimized structure is an aperiodic multilayered metamaterial exhibiting high and sharp emissivity with a Q-factor of 273. The designed metamaterials were then fabricated, and reasonable experimental realization of the optimal performance was achieved with a Q-factor of 188, which is significantly higher than those of structures empirically designed and fabricated in the past. This is the first demonstration of the experimental realization of metamaterials designed by Bayesian optimization. The results facilitate the machine-learning-based design of metamaterials and advance our understanding of the narrow-band thermal emission mechanism of aperiodic multilayered metamaterials.}

abstract = {Abstract Transparency is an important characteristic in practical applications of radiative cooling, but the transmitted sunlight trapped in an inner space is generally the main cause of the increasing temperature. A transparent radiative cooler that can lower a temperature during the daytime by transmitting visible light, reflecting near-infrared (NIR) light, and radiating thermal energy through the atmospheric window is proposed. In contrast to transparent selective emitters that transmit most of the incoming solar irradiance under direct sunlight and opaque radiative coolers that reflect all solar energy, the proposed cooler achieves transparency and the cooling effect simultaneously by selectively blocking solar absorption in the NIR regime. Outdoor rooftop measurements confirm that the cooler can reduce i) the inner temperature of an absorbing system and ii) its own temperature when combined with commercially available paints. During daytime, the cooler provides a temperature reduction of a maximum 14.4 °C and 10.1 °C for the inner and own temperature, respectively, and of an average 5.2 °C and 4.3 °C, respectively, in comparison to the transparent selective emitter. The proposed cooler can reduce the temperature during the daytime while maintaining transparency, confirming its possibilities in practical applications such as passive diurnal cooling of vehicles or buildings and compatibility with current paint technologies for aesthetic use.},

abstract = {Simulating quantum systems is believed to be one of the first applications for which quantum computers may demonstrate a useful advantage. For many problems in physics, we are interested in studying the evolution of the electron–phonon Hamiltonian, for which efficient digital quantum computing schemes exist. Yet to date, no accurate simulation of this system has been produced on real quantum hardware. In this work, we consider the absolute resource cost for gate-based quantum simulation of small electron–phonon systems as dictated by the number of Trotter steps and bosonic energy levels necessary for the convergence of dynamics. We then apply these findings to perform experiments on IBM quantum hardware for both weak and strong electron–phonon coupling. Despite significant device noise, through the use of approximate circuit recompilation we obtain electron–phonon dynamics on current quantum computers comparable to exact diagonalisation. Our results represent a significant step in utilising near term quantum computers for simulation of quantum dynamics and highlight the novelty of approximate circuit recompilation as a tool for reducing noise.}

Such large eigenvalue calculations are possible because of advances in the direct CI technology and in the iterative technique used to solve the eigenvalue equations. The CPU time per direct CI iteration varies approximately linearly with the dimension of the matrix from one million to more than one billion. One direct CI iteration is found to take about 1.2-1.4 min per million determinants on an IBM 3090/VF.}

Its unique features, such as superposition and entanglement, allow for speedup in certain computations compared to classical computers. In this paper, we show that incorporating quantum computing into a heterogeneous computation architecture is possible and potentially can greatly enhance the overall performance and efficiency of solving a wide range of problems. We propose a heterogeneous computation architecture that integrates quantum computing and classical computing. We describe how this architecture can be implemented using widely available opensource software and provide a reference implementation. We also discuss potential benefits and challenges. Our goal is to highlight the importance of seamless inclusion of quantum computing in the future of computation and how it can be achieved with tools we already have.},

@article{motta2020qite_qlanczos,
	abstract = {The accurate computation of Hamiltonian ground, excited and thermal states on quantum computers stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, from quantum simulation to machine learning. Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared with their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analogue of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit.},

	abstract = {Variational algorithms for strongly correlated chemical and materials systems are one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. We present an extension to the variational quantum eigensolver that approximates the ground state of a system by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in a subspace spanned by a collection of parametrized quantum states. This allows for the systematic improvement of a logical wavefunction ansatz without a significant increase in circuit complexity. To minimize the circuit complexity of this approach, we propose a strategy for efficiently measuring the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements between states parametrized by circuits that commute with the total particle number operator. This strategy doubles the size of the state preparation circuits but not their depth, while adding a small number of additional two-qubit gates relative to standard variational quantum eigensolver. We also propose a classical Monte Carlo scheme to estimate the uncertainty in the ground state energy caused by a finite number of measurements of the matrix elements. We explain how this Monte Carlo procedure can be extended to adaptively schedule the required measurements, reducing the number of circuit executions necessary for a given accuracy. We apply these ideas to two model strongly correlated systems, a square configuration of H4 and the π-system of hexatriene (C6H8).}

  abstract = {Quantum subspace diagonalization methods are an exciting new class of algorithms for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems using quantum computers. Unfortunately, these methods require the solution of an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem, with a matrix pencil corrupted by a nonnegligible amount of noise that is far above the machine precision. Despite pessimistic predictions from classical worst-case perturbation theories, these methods can perform reliably well if the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using a standard truncation strategy. By leveraging and advancing classical results in matrix perturbation theory, we provide a theoretical analysis of this surprising phenomenon, proving that under certain natural conditions, a quantum subspace diagonalization algorithm can accurately compute the smallest eigenvalue of a large Hermitian matrix. We give numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the theory and providing practical guidance for the choice of truncation level. Our new results can also be of independent interest to solving eigenvalue problems outside the context of quantum computation.}

abstract = {Quantum computers and simulators may offer significant advantages over their classical counterparts, providing insights into quantum many-body systems and possibly improving performance for solving exponentially hard problems, such as optimization and satisfiability. Here, we report the implementation of a low-depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using an analog quantum simulator. We estimate the ground-state energy of the Transverse Field Ising Model with long-range interactions with tunable range, and we optimize the corresponding combinatorial classical problem by sampling the QAOA output with high-fidelity, single-shot, individual qubit measurements. We execute the algorithm with both an exhaustive search and closed-loop optimization of the variational parameters, approximating the ground-state energy with up to 40 trapped-ion qubits. We benchmark the experiment with bootstrapping heuristic methods scaling polynomially with the system size. We observe, in agreement with numerics, that the QAOA performance does not degrade significantly as we scale up the system size and that the runtime is approximately independent from the number of qubits. We finally give a comprehensive analysis of the errors occurring in our system, a crucial step in the path forward toward the application of the QAOA to more general problem instances.}}

As quantum computing architectures advance and become more widely available, lower-level, system software infrastructures will be needed to enable tighter, co-processor programming and access models. Here we present XACC, a system-level software infrastructure for quantum–classical computing that promotes a service-oriented architecture to expose interfaces for core quantum programming, compilation, and execution tasks. We detail XACC's interfaces, their interactions, and its implementation as a hardware-agnostic framework for both near-term and future quantum–classical architectures. We provide concrete examples demonstrating the utility of this framework with paradigmatic tasks. Our approach lays the foundation for the development of compilers, associated runtimes, and low-level system tools tightly integrating quantum and classical workflows.}

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging computational paradigm that leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to perform elementary logic operations. Existing programming models for QC were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind, envisioning stand-alone applications. However, the susceptibility of near-term quantum computers to noise limits their stand-alone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This modus operandi calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension specification, called QCOR, which enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the QCOR library–based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables. After defining QCOR’s programming model, memory model, and execution model, we discuss how QCOR enables variational, iterative, and feed-forward QC. QCOR approaches quantum-classical computation in a hardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices of high-performance computing. The high level of abstraction in the language extension is intended to accelerate the adoption of QC by researchers familiar with classical high-performance computing.},
